# quartz-mesh-raft-hub

`quartz-mesh-raft-hub` is a focused SQL codebase around implement an SQL distributed systems project for raft policy evaluation, using deny and allow fixtures and explainable decision traces. It is meant to be easy to inspect, run, and extend without a hosted service.

## Quartz Mesh Raft Hub Walkthrough

I would read the project from the outside in: command, fixture, model, then roadmap. That keeps the distributed systems idea grounded in files that can be checked locally.

## How It Is Put Together

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying distributed systems behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The SQL project uses sqlite fixtures, views, and assertions to keep query behavior inspectable.

## Reason For The Project

This project keeps the domain idea close to the tests. That makes it useful as a reference implementation, a small experiment, or a starting point for a more specialized tool.

## Capabilities

- Uses fixture data to keep quorum behavior changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for lease timing, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents message ordering tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Data Notes

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `recovery` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Where Things Live

- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands
- `schema.sql`: sqlite schema and view definitions

## Getting It Running

Install SQL and run the commands from the repository root. The project does not need credentials or a hosted service.

## Command Examples

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Check The Work

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Tradeoffs

The repository favors determinism over breadth. It does not pull live data, keep secrets, or depend on network access for verification.

## Possible Extensions

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more distributed systems fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
